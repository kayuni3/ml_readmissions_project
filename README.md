# Predicting Readmission of Diabetic Patient (Data Analysis Project)

In this project, I cleansed a dataset and created visuals and machine learning models to predict the readmission of diabetic patients. Microsoft offers many data analysis tools. Of these tools, I used Databricks with Apache Spark and Power BI. The data set was provided by VCU's Center for Clinical and Translational Research.
